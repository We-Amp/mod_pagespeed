# prune-win-vendor.ps1 - age-guarded prune of a Windows runner's local
# vendor directory.
#
# A Windows runner may keep the vendor tarballs it fetched in a local
# directory (the runner variable CI_WIN_VENDOR_DIR, see
# docs/ci/runner-environment.md). Each run leaves a tarball of roughly
# 700 MB there, plus the temporary file of an interrupted fetch or the
# decompressed .tar of an interrupted extract. This script removes them
# once they are older than a short window.
#
# The rules match the Linux vendor job's prune:
#   * only files named mod_pagespeed-*.tar.zst, *.tar.zst.sha256 and
#     *.tar.zst.*.tmp, plus *.tar.zst.tar and *.tar.zst.*.tar (the
#     decompression intermediates) and the *.tar.zst.*.stage copies (and
#     their sidecars) that fetch-vendor-tarball.ps1 makes, and only once
#     older than -MaxAgeMinutes (default 2 hours);
#   * never this run's tarball or its sidecar (-ShortSha); this run's
#     tarball is re-stamped first, so the window counts from last use;
#   * a sidecar goes only when its tarball is gone too, so a kept tarball
#     never loses its digest.
# A live run's temporary file is younger than the window: the fetch and the
# decompression write it continuously, and no job runs longer than 2 hours.
#
# The directory named by -SharedDir (default: the CI_WIN_VENDOR_DIR runner
# variable) is left alone when it is the directory being pruned: a runner
# that shares that directory with the Linux jobs of the same machine lets
# the Linux vendor job's prune own it. Deletion errors (a file in use) are
# warnings; the prune never fails the job for them.
#
# File ages are file times, which a drive mount stamps with the other side's
# clock. When a probe file written now reads back more than -MaxSkewSeconds
# away from this host's clock, ages cannot be trusted and nothing is pruned.
#
# Usage: prune-win-vendor.ps1 -VendorDir <dir> -ShortSha <sha7>
#          [-MaxAgeMinutes 120] [-SharedDir <dir>] [-MaxSkewSeconds 120]
