# Docs-only classifier of the docs lane (docs/ci/pipelines.md, "DOCS_LANE").
#
# Usage: docs_only.sh BASE [HEAD]   (HEAD defaults to HEAD)
#
# Stdout: exactly one line, `docs_only=true` or `docs_only=false`. One
# `docs lane:` line with the reason goes to stderr. The exit code is always 0.
#
# A change is docs-only when EVERY path in `git diff BASE...HEAD` matches
# DOCS_ALLOW below. The list is an allowlist: a path it does not name, a
# missing or unknown BASE or HEAD, a failed diff and an empty diff all print
# false. Renames are not detected, so a move out of a code path still lists
# the code path it left.
#
# pr_tier_scope.sh reads this file from the default branch, never from the
# tree under test, so a pull request cannot widen its own lane. Every path
# here is one that no build, test or fleet job reads; a change to the list is
# a pipeline change (tools/ci/ is never docs-only).
