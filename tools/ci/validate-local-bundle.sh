# Decide whether a runner-local CI bundle (<dir>/.ci-artifacts) is complete and
# from the expected producer, instead of trusting a single file.
#
# Usage: validate-local-bundle.sh <bundle-dir> <expected-platform>
#
# Exit 0: every file stage-artifacts.sh installs is present and non-empty,
#         checksums.sha256 (when present) verifies, and metadata.json (when
#         present) names <expected-platform>.
# Exit 1: the bundle is partial or from another producer (reason on stderr).
#         The caller wipes it and re-fetches; this script never deletes.
#
# Why: a same-SHA bundle from another producer (the Release set has no
# ngx_pagespeed_module.so) or a half-copied bundle used to pass a bare
# `factory_worker exists` check and fail later at `install`.
#
# checksums.sha256 (every hub bundle ships one) catches a truncated-but-non-empty
# file, which an interrupted `rsync --inplace` upload leaves behind.
#
# metadata.json is optional on purpose: locally built bundles (arm64 periodic
# builds in the runner workspace) carry none. When it IS present its "platform"
# must match, which separates linux-x64 from linux-x64-periodic bundles.
