# resolve-cache-host.sh -- print a *reachable* address for the CI cache/artifact
# hub.
#
# NOTHING environment-specific is stored in this file. The hub's name and its
# fallback address come from the environment; in GitHub Actions they are
# supplied by the repository variables CI_HUB_HOST / CI_HUB_IP (wired into each
# workflow's top-level `env:`). Keep in sync with the pagespeed-optimizer copy.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The hub can carry more than one A-record on the LAN DNS: the live address
#   AND stale ones left behind by old DHCP leases / extra interfaces. The old
#   idiom -- `getent hosts <hub> | awk '{print $1; exit}'` -- grabbed the FIRST
#   resolved address and assumed any resolved IP reaches the host. That premise
#   is false: when DNS lists a dead record first, every fetch that pre-collapsed
#   to that single IP died with "No route to host" (a cross-runner artifact
#   flake; the maintainer CI went red 2026-06-23).
#   (ssh/rsync given the *hostname* survive this because OpenSSH iterates all
#   resolved addresses -- it's only the pre-resolved-to-one-IP call sites and
#   `docker --add-host`, which needs a single IP, that break.)
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Probe TCP/22 on each resolved address in turn and print the first that
#   answers; fall back to CI_HUB_IP if none do. Always exits 0 and always prints
#   something (possibly empty, if no fallback was supplied), so callers keep
#   their own `${VAR:-...}` safety net as a second line of defence.
#
# Environment
#   CI_HUB_ADDR       Skip resolution entirely and print this verbatim
#                     (use this to pin a runner via its .env).
#   CI_HUB_HOST       Hostname to resolve.
#   CI_HUB_IP         Fallback address.
#   CI_HUB_PROBE_TIMEOUT   TCP probe timeout in seconds (default 3).
