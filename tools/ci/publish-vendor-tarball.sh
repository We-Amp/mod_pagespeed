# publish-vendor-tarball.sh - Publish a vendor tarball and its digest
# sidecar into the shared vendor dir without ever replacing a tarball that
# is already there.
#
# Usage: tools/ci/publish-vendor-tarball.sh <final-tarball> [<temp-tarball>]
#   With <temp-tarball>: publish it as <final-tarball> if that name is free,
#   otherwise discard it and adopt the tarball already there. Then (and with
#   only <final-tarball>) write <final-tarball>.sha256 for whatever tarball
#   is at the final name.
#
# Environment:
#   VENDOR_EXPECT_SHA256  digest the temp tarball must have (an end-to-end
#                         check of a transfer that produced it).
#   VENDOR_VERIFY_ZSTD=1  also require the temp tarball (and an existing
#                         final one) to pass `zstd -t`.
#
# Several writers can produce the same SHA's tarball at once: two runner
# instances share one host's vendor dir, and a push-to-master run, the
# nightly and a release tag often tar the same commit. Their bytes differ
# (file mtimes), so a writer that renamed its tarball over another's could
# leave one writer's digest next to the other's tarball, and an rm-then-
# rename removed a tarball a consumer had just verified. Publication
# is therefore create-if-absent: `ln` of the temp file to the final name is
# atomic and fails if the name exists, in which case the existing tarball is
# adopted. Once published, a tarball is never replaced, so the sidecar every
# writer computes from it is the same.
#
# DrvFs (a Windows drive mounted into WSL2) can report EACCES for a rename or link
# that actually landed, and can show a just-created name as briefly absent.
# Every publish step is therefore judged by its result (the file is there
# and complete, the sidecar holds the digest), never by the exit status of
# the command alone. Where hard links are unsupported, a plain rename onto
# the still-free name is the fallback. That fallback is not exclusive: on a
# filesystem without hard links two publishers can both see the name as free
# and the second rename replaces the first, so "a sound tarball is never
# rewritten" holds only where `ln` works. Sidecars still converge on the
# tarball that ends up there, and readers retry until tarball and digest agree.
